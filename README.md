# OSS json parser

1. understanding on json parser

   - json file is basically text file which is independent from certain programming language

   - it contains various data with designed syntax which is universally promised

2. process

   - first, read json file in C file
   - consider the whole data as sequence of characters
   - parse them (tokenize the characters based on promised syntax of json file)
   - print meaningful data out in certain form

3. implementation progress

   - complete file read
   - working on parsing with token '{, }' which are the start point and end point of objects
